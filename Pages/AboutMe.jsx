                    <p>
                    i've been studying web design on my own for one year, i felt my own studying was lacking so i wanted to get formal training. what drew me to web design is the creative problem-solving, the fast-paced environment, and the continuous innovation. I want to expand on my skills so one day i can be a freelance proficient web developer, that travels the world.
